We\'ve been building Rives for a while using the amazing technology developed by Cartesi, so, what better way to celebrate our Base mainnet launch with our community than to hold olympic games?\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nAs an onchain console, we are going to pay our respects to one of the most iconic games: Doom. The Doom engine was opensourced and can be found [here](https://github.com/id-Software/DOOM). Unfortunately, the assets don\'t really benefit from the same license, so we are going to use a community developed Doom called [Freedoom](https://github.com/freedoom/freedoom) which is based on the original engine and community made assets (monsters, levels, weapons, etc).\\n\\n# How is this possible?\\n   Wow, this is super cool, but isn\'t that game too heavy to execute in a verifiable manner onchain? If you try to execute the game directly onchain on Ethereum, yes! So what do we do? We execute it inside the Cartesi Machine, which is a deterministic RISC-V emulator, which runs both in the Rives (app-specific) rollup validators and in the user machine (as we had the sizeable effort of porting the Cartesi Machine to the browser by compiling it to WebAssembly) and that allows us to execute this complex piece of art in real time in a deterministic fashion. While the user plays the game, the movements are being recorded along with the simulation tick in which they were performed and after the match is done they can be submitted onchain so the validator can verify the match, resimulating the entire game and verifying the score and other achievements.\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\">\\n![Rives Flow](/img/blog/rives_flow.jpg)\\n</div>\\n> The flow that a gameplay goes through on Rives\\n\\n# Prizes\\n\\nLet\'s detail a bit the prizes that are available at the Doom Olympics:\\n- 7000 usd for the winners of the contests (For each contest: 600 for the 1st place, 300 for the 2nd and 100 for the 3rd place)\\n- 3500 usd spread across the top 100 players on the Doom Olympics global leaderboard\\n- 4500 usd for achievements, quests and more\\n\\nTo be eligible for the prize, you must follow RIVES on [Twitter](https://x.com/rives_io) and/or be part of the [Discord community](https://discord.gg/FQnQqKWVn8)\\n\\nRewards will be paid out in CTSI.\\n\\n# The games\\n  \\nGreat, what about the games?

I love how we are starting to see creators express themselves across different game genres. Past participants are stepping up their game further, yet have a recognizable style. Some high-quality games were built in this JAM! Also, great to see new people diving into the game creation craft. One of the goals of RIVES is to reduce the entry barriers for building games and make it fun for anyone to create. Having someone who hasn\'t coded much before, join, is a first form of validation that we\'re on the right track!\\n\\nVery excited to play these games on app.rives.io (soon), compete on custom leaderboards, and generate tapes.  \\n\\nThe final ranking for this jam, after voting is as follows: \\n\\n1. Wizard Pest Control Services Inc by [Ednekebno](https://x.com/ednekebno)\\n2. Forgotten Survivors by [Pickleberto](https://x.com/pickleberto)\\n3. Flappy Spider by [Nidaabaris](https://x.com/nidaaBaris)\\n\\nYou can find the votes across criteria [here](https://itch.io/jam/rives2/results). \\n \\nWe hope that everyone who participated enjoyed this JAM!

Grinding to make that perfect run and someone else claims your glory. Servers that are shutdown from your favorite game because they are no longer profitable. Developer nerfs that character you put hundreds of hours grinding to level up. Does that ring a bell? To bring fun back to games (both for players and developers) we are building Rives. Rives is the first onchain fantasy console. Every single game in Rives is verifiable, validated in a Cartesi Rollup and secured by the blockchain consensus.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## The web2 game development way\\n\\nOk, great! But how is that possible? In traditional web2 games the most common model is having a client-server architecture. Players have their interface rendering the graphics, receiving the player inputs that are relayed to the server and receiving updates from the server with the current game state. The server is the authority and dictates what is the truth of that game. You trust the server will not censor you nor cheat you in any way (like tempering with a random number that might change the outcome of a battle or the rarity of that loot you are getting at the end of a quest). Since everyone needs to trust the server there is not much that can be done. There are no guarantees the server will do the right thing, there is no transparency and if something fishy is going on there is really no way to dispute it and make things right. \\n\\n## Onchain games\\n\\nOnchain games, on the other hand, are built differently. Verifiability is at the center of the narrative. The game logic is generally built on smart contracts in which the execution is performed by a very large number of nodes. Want to temper with a random number on a game running on Ethereum? Good luck colluding with hundreds of thousands of nodes to make it happen. You can independently run the game logic yourself and check that everything works as intended, no one tempering with the game state or lying about their epic achievements. The system is built with programmatic and economic mechanisms that makes it either impossible or just bad business to cheat on a game. That is great! But what is the catch? Well, onchain logic is slow and expensive. At the time of writing this article, Ethereum max gas per block is 30M gas and the cheapest useful instructions cost 3 gas (add/subtract/not and others - [check the EVM OPCODES table](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/opcodes/)). A block is produced every [12s on average](https://ycharts.com/indicators/ethereum_average_block_time). That means that the best case scenario is, with monopoly of the network, to process around 50M instructions per minute. That is really not a lot. Now let\'s take a look at the costs. Checking a [gas price tracker](https://etherscan.io/gastracker#chart_gasprice) the entire 30M gas of a block would cost around 900 USD (Ethereum price 3,305.06 USD and gas price 9 gwei), so that would be around 4500USD per minute. That is pretty expensive!\\n\\n## The ZK games\\nModern onchain games want to break the latency, cost and processing limitations that they are faced with. The onchaing gaming community is currently bubbling with multiple different approaches with different trade-offs to tackle these issues. Some games are taking advantage of Zero-Knowledge (ZK) to run logic outside the blockchain scope. The logic executed outside has a ZK circuit that generates a proof of the correct execution of that code. The generated proof can later be verified so that the outcome of that computation can be applied and known to be correct. For a crash course on Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) you might want to [check this article](https://medium.com/coinmonks/zero-knowledge-proofs-um-what-a092f0ee9f28). ZKPs have a number of nice things, like allowing you to perform larger computations, still secured, outside of the blockchain and also privacy properties since you can make verifiable assertions over data you don\'t reveal, but they also have some drawbacks. Computing the proof of a computation grows exponentially with the size of the computation you want to prove, which imposes a steep overhead for the actual computation, limiting the feasibility of performing very large computations both from a financial and from hardware point of view. Most ZKP solution providers offer incentivized or altruistic services with clusters of supercomputers to make it practical to generate ZKPs of computations in a short time. Though that is nice, it also harms decentralization as it\'s not possible for a random person with consumer hardware to be a validator themselves.\\n\\n## The OR games\\n\\nOthers rely on solutions that are known as Optimistic Rollups (ORs). In ORs, the validators of a computation perform it outside of the blockchain and periodically make a claim on the base blockchain about the state of that computation, generally a hash of the computation state or the VM that is executing it. Other validators check that claim and if they find it to be incorrect, engage in a dispute with a different protocol depending on the OR solution. ORs also have a number of great properties and drawbacks. A good property of ORs is that they add very little overhead on the computation they secure: validators execute the computation once if they agree with the claim and at most less than twice in case of a dispute for most dispute protocols. The main disadvantage of ORs is the delay of finality: you need to wait after a claim is made so other validators have time to check it and dispute it in case it\'s incorrect. If you wait a small period to consider the claim undisputed you get faster finality but weaker security and if you wait a large amount of time you gain on security but delay finality.\\n\\n## The sharded approach\\n\\nSome onchain game solutions are taking another approach that trades security for speed: they basically make an application or even session specific blockchain with a very small set of validators, enabling fast consensus and a high block production frequency (one per second or even more). That enables a lot of interesting games, even real time ones but at the expense of security - a rather small number of nodes can settle on an incorrect state as colluding with small numbers becomes very practical.\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"><iframe src=\\"https://emulator.rives.io/#simple=true&cartridge=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edubart/cartridges/main/jam1/realninjachallenge.sqfs\\" allowFullScreen className=\\"rivemu-frame\\"></iframe></div>\\n\\n> Ok, care for a break? Here is a nice Rives minigame. Just press the white play button. Controls: Press Z to begin. Use the arrow keys to slash the fruits appearing on screen\\n\\n\\n## Rives approach\\n\\nIn Rives we value a very high standard for decentralization and security. We want anyone to be able to verify that a match outcome matches the claim and we want that to happen even if the honest player is surrounded by opponents colluding. The way we handle this is quite different from other approaches. At the base of our technology we use Cartesi Rollups: Cartesi Rollups are an OR solution that creates a rollup per application and with an execution environment called the Cartesi Machine. The Cartesi Machine is a deterministic RISC-V Linux-enabled emulator capable of executing traditional (web2) software stacks and enabling computations multiple orders of magnitude larger than what the base layer allows, with reasonable costs. Remember the computation capacity and costs for Ethereum presented earlier in this article? Just booting a lean Ubuntu distro with no graphical interface takes under a second on a Cartesi Machine in a regular laptop, and that accounts for over 3B RISC-V instructions. That alone would take the processing power of over an hour of the Ethereum network and cost over 270k USD. The tech is pretty amazing and if you want to read more about it you can do so on [their site](https://cartesi.io).\\n\\nLeveraging the power of the Cartesi technology we did something pretty interesting: we ported the Cartesi Machine to webassembly. Because of that, we can run Cartesi computations in the browser, directly on the client with no need for any special setups on the user machine (and yes, we have a full Linux distro running in there). Why did we do that? We want both players and developers to have a good experience with Rives. If we had games in which the client would basically render the interface and relay the player inputs to the blockchain, retrieving the updated game state for it, we would have high latency and that would severely limit the kind of games that could be developed (should be delay tolerant games, like turn based games). By having games running directly on the user browser we can have highly interactive games and latency is not an issue. Ok, but you could develop games directly on the browser, why the Cartesi Machine? Great question! The answer is pretty simple: when you have a decentralized game, you need the game logic to be deterministic in order to have others verifying it and reach consensus and it\'s pretty difficult to write deterministic software as there are so many sources of entropy: unspecified hardware behavior (like for floating point operations), wall clocks, different versions of runtime environment components, etc. Using a Cartesi Machine on the browser instantly makes any game running inside it deterministic! The game developer can focus on building their game without having to worry about making their code deterministic.\\n\\nThe basic flow in Rives today is: \\nThe user enters [our site](https://rives.io) and selects a game. When they do that, they download to their computer our fantasy console (RIV) and the cartridge containing the game they want to play (both downloaded from the Rives Cartesi Rollup node and verifiable on chain). \\nThe user then executes the game locally and has a smooth experience - plays the game in real time, hopefully has some fun :) - and while that is happening, RIV logs all the player actions and the tick in the game simulation in which they happened. \\nAfter they are done, this log is submitted onchain to the Rives Cartesi Rollup in a very efficient compact format. When that happens, a Rives validator will download the gameplay and reproduce the entire game simulation, validating the score, achievements and any other relevant outcome of that gaming session. Periodically Rives validators submit a claim on chain about the state of the Rives application. The current model is authority based but we\xb4ll migrate to a decentralized model in which if a wrong claim is submitted a single honest validator is enough to enforce the right state (security guarantee inherited from the Cartesi Rollups, checkout [the whitepaper](https://cdn.sanity.io/files/zg5gx8g4/production/80a9e273750ef765a011a0ccc822b49f797fd7fd.pdf) and the [scientific paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12439) for the future version that converges faster in case of multiple disputes).\\n\\n## The RIV API\\n\\nTo make it easy for developers to create their games without a steep learning curve, RIV has a powerful and simple API. The API is available in C but you can easily code in your preferred language with a simple wrapper for it. There are multiple examples in different languages available [here](https://github.com/rives-io/riv/tree/main/demos), and we have a comprehensive documentation for you to get started available [here](https://docs.rives.io). Recently we had [our first game jam](https://docs.rives.io/blog/jam1recap) and most developers were able to get started on Rives, read the documentation and develop their own game within one or two days. Our focus with Rives is making retro style games a joy, fast and easy to develop and publish. Currently the focus is on single-player or local co-op games, but we are working on different approaches to enable co-op games over network and later adversarial games (which are particularly challenging to protect from bad behavior on a decentralized setup - but that is a topic to explore in a future article :) ). RIV currently runs a custom Linux distro called RIV OS based on Alpine Linux and gives a lot of flexibility and nice tooling to make developing a Rives game an enjoyable experience.\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"><div class=\\"rivemu-compact-frame pixelated\\">\\n![Space cookies invasion](/img/blog/space_cookies_invasion.png)\\n</div></div>\\n> A space cookie invaders might be the next game you want to make\\n\\nOk, that was a pretty long article, so thank you for taking the time to read it and making it this far.

The Jam was also hosted on [Itch.io](https://itch.io/jam/rives1) and is the first in many RIVES jams to come!!\\n\\nWe had over 40 participants and 9 submissions for this first edition. The jam focused on retro games with metrics to establish a score. A metric system (that can be used to establish a score) was a requirement for this jam. RIVES can natively add players to leaderboards based on their scores, making this an interesting criteria for the jam.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nCheck out the great games developed during the jam below. You can test them directly here, or compete onchain in the RIVES app. \\n\\n\\n### Peeyow by [Ednekebno](https://x.com/ednekebno)\\n\\nThe plot of every good sci-fi movie but now you can live and breathe it in a retro game! Your planet is under attack, so you fight some colorful alien spaceships. It\'s a side-scrolling shooter and the enemies have unique movement/shooting patterns. Read through the full description to get even more pumped before you give it a try. Can\u2019t mess with the diner\u2026\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"><iframe src=\\"https://emulator.rives.io/#simple=true&cartridge=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edubart/cartridges/main/jam1/peeyow.sqfs\\" allowFullScreen className=\\"rivemu-frame\\"></iframe></div>\\n\\n> Controls: Arrow keys: move, D: fire\\n\\n - [Itch page](https://ednekebno.itch.io/peeyow)\\n\\n\\n### Blockie by [Ednekebno](https://x.com/ednekebno)\\n\\nEdnekebno was on a roll for this first jam, as he submitted two games! This is the firs game he submitted, and it helped him get used to the system. It\'s a color-matching puzzle game. It looks like tetris on the surface but has its own unique set of rules. Beyond creating a fun game, this project is also technically interesting. The cartridge has a built-in MIDI player, which can play .mid files.\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"><iframe src=\\"https://emulator.rives.io/#simple=true&cartridge=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edubart/cartridges/main/jam1/blockie.sqfs\\" allowFullScreen className=\\"rivemu-frame\\"></iframe></div>\\n\\n> Controls: Up to rotate blocks, Left and Right to move\\n\\n\\n - [Itch page](https://ednekebno.itch.io/blockie)\\n\\n###  Real ninja challenge by [AleisterCodely](https://x.com/AleisterCodely) \\n\\nI love slashing fruits almost as much as I love eating them. Fruit Ninja was one of my first iPhone experiences back in the day. Not the typical console nostalgia, but it brought back some memories of experiencing the magic of touch for the first time. Also has some guitar hero vibes but with fruits, very cool.\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"><iframe src=\\"https://emulator.rives.io/#simple=true&cartridge=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edubart/cartridges/main/jam1/realninjachallenge.sqfs\\" allowFullScreen className=\\"rivemu-frame\\"></iframe></div>\\n\\n> Controls: A to begin, Arrows: slash fruits appearing on screen\\n\\n\\n - [Itch page](https://aleistercodely.itch.io/real-ninja-challenge)\\n - [Github](https://github.com/AleisterCodely/rivemu-real-ninja-challenge)\\n\\n### Simple City Builder by [DeLuxe1337](https://deluxe1337.itch.io/)\\n\\nThis game has a very different theme compared to the other games in this jam, this one is more strategic, you need to build a sustainable city and economy. Beyond being a score-based game, this could be an interesting fit for tapes. Build out a beautiful city, and interesting road systems and generate a unique tape of your setup.\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"><iframe src=\\"https://emulator.rives.io/#simple=true&cartridge=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edubart/cartridges/main/jam1/simple-city-builder.sqfs\\" allowFullScreen className=\\"rivemu-frame\\"></iframe></div>\\n\\n> Controls: Q: open menu, arrows: move and pick location, F/W: build\\n\\n - [Itch page](https://deluxe1337.itch.io/simple-city-builder)\\n\\n### River Rives by [pickleberto](https://x.com/pickleberto)\\n\\nI was not born yet when the [Atari 2600](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_2600) came out, so this was my first time getting the [River Raid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Raid) feeling. And I now understand why this was a classic game. Simple yet addictive!\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"><iframe src=\\"https://emulator.rives.io/#simple=true&cartridge=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edubart/cartridges/main/jam1/river-rives.sqfs\\" allowFullScreen className=\\"rivemu-frame\\"></iframe></div>\\n\\n> Controls: Left and right: move horizontally; Up: speed up; Down: slow down; Z key or gamepad button A1: fire\\n\\n\\n - [Itch page](https://pickleberto.itch.io/river-rives)\\n\\n### Breakout for Rives by [dtuler](https://x.com/dtuler)\\n\\nBreakout is a classic arcade video game developed and published by Atari and designed by Steve Wozniak. Danilo shipped this game in record time, the jam had just started. I remember playing this on the iPod Nano back in the early 2000s. I could see mods/custom rules emerge around a base game like Breakout.\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"><iframe src=\\"https://emulator.rives.io/#simple=true&cartridge=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edubart/cartridges/main/jam1/breakout.sqfs\\" allowFullScreen className=\\"rivemu-frame\\"></iframe></div>\\n\\n> Controls: Arrows to move, Z to kickoff ball\\n\\n - [Itch page](https://dtuler.itch.io/breakout-rives)\\n - [Github](https://github.com/tuler/breakout-rives)\\n\\n### Dave Raid by [Fabio Oshiro](https://x.com/fabiooshiro)\\n\\nFabio built a very cool combo game. Shoot down the red enemies with your fighter plane, and then answer trivia questions to move to the next stage. Love the questions and lore which center around cartesi, the tech used to power rives. Make sure to read the description on itch. Fun concept!\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"><iframe src=\\"https://emulator.rives.io/#simple=true&cartridge=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edubart/cartridges/main/jam1/dave-raid.sqfs\\" allowFullScreen className=\\"rivemu-frame\\"></iframe></div>\\n\\n> Controls: Arrows: move, S: fire\\n\\n - [Itch page](https://fabiooshiro.itch.io/dave-raid)\\n - [Github](https://github.com/fabiooshiro/dave-raid)\\n\\n### Bladebomber by [Edubart](https://github.com/edubart)\\n\\nEduardo is part of the core RIVES team, focused on building RIV itself (so the game was disqualified from prizes). Bladebomber is written in pure C. Eduardo built it to demonstrate the RIV console C API. Furthermore it can serve as an example or template for future dungeon-crawler-type games on RIVES. A player could also easily build custom maps to extend the game in the future. This is a beautiful and fun game to play, and I love how Eduardo got to build this with his girlfriend who focused on designing the levels.\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"><iframe src=\\"https://emulator.rives.io/#simple=true&cartridge=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edubart/cartridges/main/jam1/bladebomber.sqfs\\" allowFullScreen className=\\"rivemu-frame\\"></iframe></div>\\n\\n> Controls: UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT: Walk, Z: Dash, X : Use blade, C: Use bomb\\n\\n - [Itch page](https://edubart.itch.io/bladebomber)\\n - [Github](https://github.com/edubart/bladebomber)\\n\\n### Life is hard by [Lyno](https://github.com/lynoferraz)\\n\\nThis is not just any game, it\'s \\"[Game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)\\" running on RIVES! Lyno is also a core RIVES team member and wanted to build a unique game that uniquely fits tapes. The lifeforms you create can take on many shapes, making every tape a unique creation/life that can be shared, collected, and enjoyed. To play, place the desired cells and let the simulation run. Lyno also added an interesting metric system which you can read about on the itch page. \\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"><iframe src=\\"https://emulator.rives.io/#simple=true&cartridge=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edubart/cartridges/main/jam1/life.sqfs\\" allowFullScreen className=\\"rivemu-frame\\"></iframe></div>\\n\\n> Controls: Arrows: move the cursor and keep pressed to move faster, Z/A1 to set/unset cell,  X/A2: to start the simulation\\n\\n- [Itch page](https://fergo6.itch.io/life-is-hard)\\n- [Github](https://github.com/edubart/bladebomber)\\n\\n\\n## After-Jam\\n\\nThanks to everyone who participated. Every one of these games is amazing in their unique way. We were blown away by the great builders and games that were created. There was also a vote for prizes, where submitters and organizers could vote on itch. The final winners were:\\n\\n1: Peeyow\\n2: Blockie\\n3: Real Ninja challenge.\\n\\nWe hope that everyone who participated enjoyed building on RIVES. One of our key objectives is to bring back the joy of creating (games). We look forward to seeing you continue to build out your games and/or start a new one. Keep an eye out for Jam #2 coming soon!\\n\\nYou can also view the post-jam community call video below, where we play the games and discuss feedback and impressions from the participants and players.\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"><iframe id=\\"ytplayer\\" type=\\"text/html\\" width=\\"640\\" height=\\"360\\"\\n  src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EJotbYRbmgk\\"\\n  frameborder=\\"0\\"></iframe></div>"}]}}')}}]);
