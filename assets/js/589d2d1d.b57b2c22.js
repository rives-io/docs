The logic executed outside has a ZK circuit that generates a proof of the correct execution of that code.

ZKPs have a number of nice things, like allowing you to perform larger computations, still secured, outside of the blockchain and also privacy properties since you can make verifiable assertions over data you don't reveal, but they also have some drawbacks. Computing the proof of a computation grows exponentially with the size of the computation you want to prove, which imposes a steep overhead for the actual computation, limiting the feasibility of performing very large computations both from a financial and from hardware point of view. Most ZKP solution providers offer incentivized or altruistic services with clusters of supercomputers to make it practical to generate ZKPs of computations in a short time.

Other validators check that claim and if they find it to be incorrect, engage in a dispute with a different protocol depending on the OR solution. ORs also have a number of great properties and drawbacks. A good property of ORs is that they add very little overhead on the computation they secure: validators execute the computation once if they agree with the claim and at most less than twice in case of a dispute for most dispute protocols. The main disadvantage of ORs is the delay of finality: you need to wait after a claim is made so other validators have time to check it and dispute it in case it's incorrect.

The way we handle this is quite different from other approaches. At the base of our technology we use Cartesi Rollups: Cartesi Rollups are an OR solution that creates a rollup per application and with an execution environment called the Cartesi Machine. The Cartesi Machine is a deterministic RISC-V Linux-enabled emulator capable of executing traditional (web2) software stacks and enabling computations multiple orders of magnitude larger than what the base layer allows, with reasonable costs. Remember the computation capacity and costs for Ethereum presented earlier in this article? Just booting a lean Ubuntu distro with no graphical interface takes under a second on a Cartesi Machine in a regular laptop, and that accounts for over 3B RISC-V instructions.

Because of that, we can run Cartesi computations in the browser, directly on the client with no need for any special setups on the user machine (and yes, we have a full Linux distro running in there). Why did we do that? We want both players and developers to have a good experience with Rives. If we had games in which the client would basically render the interface and relay the player inputs to the blockchain, retrieving the updated game state for it, we would have high latency and that would severely limit the kind of games that could be developed (should be delay tolerant games, like turn based games). By having games running directly on the user browser we can have highly interactive games and latency is not an issue. Ok, but you could develop games directly on the browser, why the Cartesi Machine? Great question! The answer is pretty simple: when you have a decentralized game, you need the game logic to be deterministic in order to have others verifying it and reach consensus and it's pretty difficult to write deterministic software as there are so many sources of entropy: unspecified hardware behavior (like for floating point operations), wall clocks, different versions of runtime environment components, etc. Using a Cartesi Machine on the browser instantly makes any game running inside it deterministic!
