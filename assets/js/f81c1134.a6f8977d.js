The legion of fans keep up a true cult around it and there are all sorts of groups involved with the game. One of my favorite groups is the one that ports Doom everywhere. Some crazy examples include home appliances like a [washing machine](https://www.reddit.com/r/itrunsdoom/comments/1budbid/doom_on_the_new_samsung_allinone_washer/) or a [smart toothbrush](https://www.reddit.com/r/itrunsdoom/comments/1b2lgxw/doom_runs_on_wifi_toothbrush_without_hardware_mods/) \\n\\nBut there was still a barrier for Doom to break: the blockchain.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\">\\n![Doom on a washing machine](/img/blog/doom_on_washing_machine.jpg)\\n</div>\\n> No idea how to input commands in there\\n\\n# Blockchain computational capability limitations\\n\\nBlockchain is an amazing technology and has come a long way in a really small amount of time. From just a ledger and payment system on the initial Bitcoin release up to the current environment with hundreds of different projects pushing the barrier of what is possible. Taking a look at Ethereum, it\'s easy to understand why putting Doom onchain is such a daunting task. \\n\\nCurrently the Ethereum Blockchain has a maximum amount of gas per block of 30M, which is enough to compute at most 10M instructions (optimistically, considering the cheapest useful instructions cost 3 gas, like ADD or SUB). Considering the average time of 12s per block that gives us less than a million operations per second (or less than 1MHz) for the \u201cWorld Computer\u201d CPU, as Ethereum is known. And that is what the entire network with everyone in the world has available, so executing Doom directly on Ethereum is a no go. \\n\\n# Bringing Doom onchain\\n\\nIn the past a 1st approach of [storing a Doom like game as data onchain](https://blockworks.co/news/play-doom-bitcoin) was performed and people could read it from the ledger and play the game. It\'s a nice step, but gives you no consensus over the result achieved (everyone just plays locally and no one else verifies anything) thus doesn\'t really give many advantages over just running a copy of the game you downloaded from a server on your machine (besides having downloaded it from a decentralized ledger).\\n\\nWe were way bolder: we wanted to have a playable Doom that can be verified onchain (though that is super complex as Doom requires a LOT of CPU power by the blockchain standards). This was all born last year when one of our devs accepted a bold challenge: executing Doom in a verifiable manner in real time. In order to do that he used the Cartesi Machine (a deterministic RISC-V virtual machine) and delivered on that.\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\">\\n![Eduardo\'s tweet on bringing Doom to the Cartesi Machine](/img/blog/doom_tweet.jpg)\\n</div>\\n> Eduardo\u2019s triumphant tweet displaying Doom executing in real time inside the Cartesi Machine\\n\\nFrom there it was a matter of putting that onchain: turning the Doom execution inside a Cartesi Machine into a DApp using [Cartesi Rollups](https://docs.cartesi.io/cartesi-rollups/1.5/core-concepts/optimistic-rollups/#cartesi-rollups) solution (which is an app chain framework that turns Cartesi Machine computations into Optimistic Rollups fully verifiable). \\n\\nThe final touch is making it easy for the user to execute (and also for developer to develop games). How do we achieve that? We execute the Cartesi Machine both in the validator nodes and in the user machine (as we had the sizeable effort of porting the Cartesi Machine to the browser by compiling it to WebAssembly) and that allows us to execute this complex piece of art in real time in a deterministic fashion - without the burden of adapting the code to make it deterministic, thanks Cartesi Machine. While the user plays the game, the movements are being recorded along with the simulation tick in which they were performed and after the match is done they can be submitted onchain so the validator can verify the match, resimulating the entire game and verifying the score and other achievements.\\n\\nNice, but was that all that was needed? No! Freedoom expects to draw on the screen using the native graphical interface as well as play audio using the native audio device, we also had to change it to use the [RIV Api](https://github.com/rives-io/riv/blob/main/libriv/riv.h) to accomplish those tasks. Once that was done, Freedoom was ready to become a [RIV cartridge](https://github.com/rives-io/cartridge-freedoom) and enter the world of Rives!\\n\\nThis is quite a breakthrough, let\u2019s dive a bit on the details. A 30 min session of Freedoom takes around [96B RISC-V CPU cycles](https://rives.io/docs/riv/introduction#console-specs). Going back to the Ethereum network capacity of optimistically executing 10M instructions per 12s or around 50M instructions per minute, at that rate, to execute 96B instructions it would take 32 hours with monopoly over the entire network capacity - something that is not practical and would cost way more than anyone is willing to pay to verify a Freedoom match.\\n\\n# Other approaches to bring Doom onchain\\n\\nOther projects have taken different approaches to achieve similar objectives. \\n\\nRisc Zero has [proven a 1m28s demo of Doom](https://www.risczero.com/blog/when-the-doom-music-kicks-in) using a different approach: they took a Doom implementation that is meant to be executed without an OS (ours is executing on top of an Alpine Linux inside the Cartesi Machine) and ported it to execute directly inside their RISC V VM. Then they have used their prover to generate a ZK proof of the gameplay. To do that on a timely fashion they used a cluster of 250 g4dn.xlarge instances on Amazon (which cost on demand $0.526 per hour). It took them about 33 mins with the 250 g4dn.xlarge instances to generate the proof of the 1min 28s gameplay (which is a fantastic technological feat, but not very practical). They also did another demo without the rendering, just the core game logic that drastically diminishes the number of CPU cycles of the computation (over 70 times) and were able to generate the proof in under 2 minutes. \\n\\nAnother recent approach was taken by the Cardano Hydra team that executed [Doom on a Hydra L2](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra-doom), which is basically a state channel that goes back to the Cardano L1. It is an interesting approach but the lack of data availability of the player moves outside the state channel renders the verification of the game by other parties not feasible, plus the trust assumptions for a global leaderboard are not met.\\n\\n# The Doom Olympics and the Rives \\"rules\\" feature\\n\\nOk, so a after this long tour explaining the technical difficulties about bringing Doom onchain and various approaches that were tried with this objective in mind, here comes an invitation:  come celebrate Rives mainnet launch with our Doom Olympics starting September 12th 2024. A new contest starts everyday and lasts 48hrs. There are seven different modalities of Doom that require different styles of gameplay to thrive. The modalities are: Lightning Run, Knuckle Crusher, Infallible Aim, Secret Master, Treasure Seeker, The Completionist and Enemy Eradicator! Each modality forces the player to have a completely different playstile ranging from running superfast to the end of the level without caring for enemies or items up to taking every step and shot cautiously and being as precise as possible.\\n\\nWe are able to make these completely different ways to play Doom due to a very nice Rives feature: rules. In this feature, anyone can set up a rule for a game and to customize the experience, parameters can be provided for the game (like manipulating the starting level, available items, number of lives or any other thing the game developer provides) and also a formula to evaluate the score (considering the metrics provided by the developer as outputs, like time, number of lives at the end of the match, level reached, items used/collected, etc). These input parameters are part of what we call incard while the output metrics are part of what we call outcard. You can also setup a time period for a rule to be played (which is what we are doing for the 7 contests of the Doom Olympics).\\n\\n# See you at the Doom Olympics!\\n\\nWell, this wraps up this article!

The Doom engine was opensourced and can be found [here](https://github.com/id-Software/DOOM).

If you try to execute the game directly onchain on Ethereum, yes! So what do we do? We execute it inside the Cartesi Machine, which is a deterministic RISC-V emulator, which runs both in the Rives (app-specific) rollup validators and in the user machine (as we had the sizeable effort of porting the Cartesi Machine to the browser by compiling it to WebAssembly) and that allows us to execute this complex piece of art in real time in a deterministic fashion.

I love how we are starting to see creators express themselves across different game genres. Past participants are stepping up their game further, yet have a recognizable style. Some high-quality games were built in this JAM! Also, great to see new people diving into the game creation craft. One of the goals of RIVES is to reduce the entry barriers for building games and make it fun for anyone to create. Having someone who hasn\'t coded much before, join, is a first form of validation that we\'re on the right track!\\n\\nVery excited to play these games on app.rives.io (soon), compete on custom leaderboards, and generate tapes.  \\n\\nThe final ranking for this jam, after voting is as follows: \\n\\n1. Wizard Pest Control Services Inc by [Ednekebno](https://x.com/ednekebno)\\n2. Forgotten Survivors by [Pickleberto](https://x.com/pickleberto)\\n3. Flappy Spider by [Nidaabaris](https://x.com/nidaaBaris)\\n\\nYou can find the votes across criteria [here](https://itch.io/jam/rives2/results). \\n \\nWe hope that everyone who participated enjoyed this JAM!

Developer nerfs that character you put hundreds of hours grinding to level up. Does that ring a bell? To bring fun back to games (both for players and developers) we are building Rives.

The server is the authority and dictates what is the truth of that game. You trust the server will not censor you nor cheat you in any way (like tempering with a random number that might change the outcome of a battle or the rarity of that loot you are getting at the end of a quest). Since everyone needs to trust the server there is not much that can be done. There are no guarantees the server will do the right thing, there is no transparency and if something fishy is going on there is really no way to dispute it and make things right. \\n\\n## Onchain games\\n\\nOnchain games, on the other hand, are built differently. Verifiability is at the center of the narrative. The game logic is generally built on smart contracts in which the execution is performed by a very large number of nodes. Want to temper with a random number on a game running on Ethereum? Good luck colluding with hundreds of thousands of nodes to make it happen. You can independently run the game logic yourself and check that everything works as intended, no one tempering with the game state or lying about their epic achievements. The system is built with programmatic and economic mechanisms that makes it either impossible or just bad business to cheat on a game. That is great! But what is the catch? Well, onchain logic is slow and expensive. At the time of writing this article, Ethereum max gas per block is 30M gas and the cheapest useful instructions cost 3 gas (add/subtract/not and others - [check the EVM OPCODES table](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/opcodes/)). A block is produced every [12s on average](https://ycharts.com/indicators/ethereum_average_block_time). That means that the best case scenario is, with monopoly of the network, to process around 50M instructions per minute. That is really not a lot. Now let\'s take a look at the costs. Checking a [gas price tracker](https://etherscan.io/gastracker#chart_gasprice) the entire 30M gas of a block would cost around 900 USD (Ethereum price 3,305.06 USD and gas price 9 gwei), so that would be around 4500USD per minute. That is pretty expensive!\\n\\n## The ZK games\\nModern onchain games want to break the latency, cost and processing limitations that they are faced with. The onchaing gaming community is currently bubbling with multiple different approaches with different trade-offs to tackle these issues. Some games are taking advantage of Zero-Knowledge (ZK) to run logic outside the blockchain scope. The logic executed outside has a ZK circuit that generates a proof of the correct execution of that code. The generated proof can later be verified so that the outcome of that computation can be applied and known to be correct. For a crash course on Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) you might want to [check this article](https://medium.com/coinmonks/zero-knowledge-proofs-um-what-a092f0ee9f28). ZKPs have a number of nice things, like allowing you to perform larger computations, still secured, outside of the blockchain and also privacy properties since you can make verifiable assertions over data you don\'t reveal, but they also have some drawbacks. Computing the proof of a computation grows exponentially with the size of the computation you want to prove, which imposes a steep overhead for the actual computation, limiting the feasibility of performing very large computations both from a financial and from hardware point of view. Most ZKP solution providers offer incentivized or altruistic services with clusters of supercomputers to make it practical to generate ZKPs of computations in a short time. Though that is nice, it also harms decentralization as it\'s not possible for a random person with consumer hardware to be a validator themselves.\\n\\n## The OR games\\n\\nOthers rely on solutions that are known as Optimistic Rollups (ORs). In ORs, the validators of a computation perform it outside of the blockchain and periodically make a claim on the base blockchain about the state of that computation, generally a hash of the computation state or the VM that is executing it. Other validators check that claim and if they find it to be incorrect, engage in a dispute with a different protocol depending on the OR solution. ORs also have a number of great properties and drawbacks. A good property of ORs is that they add very little overhead on the computation they secure: validators execute the computation once if they agree with the claim and at most less than twice in case of a dispute for most dispute protocols. The main disadvantage of ORs is the delay of finality: you need to wait after a claim is made so other validators have time to check it and dispute it in case it\'s incorrect. If you wait a small period to consider the claim undisputed you get faster finality but weaker security and if you wait a large amount of time you gain on security but delay finality.\\n\\n## The sharded approach\\n\\nSome onchain game solutions are taking another approach that trades security for speed: they basically make an application or even session specific blockchain with a very small set of validators, enabling fast consensus and a high block production frequency (one per second or even more). That enables a lot of interesting games, even real time ones but at the expense of security - a rather small number of nodes can settle on an incorrect state as colluding with small numbers becomes very practical.\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"><iframe src=\\"https://emulator.rives.io/#simple=true&cartridge=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edubart/cartridges/main/jam1/realninjachallenge.sqfs\\" allowFullScreen className=\\"rivemu-frame\\"></iframe></div>\\n\\n> Ok, care for a break? Here is a nice Rives minigame. Just press the white play button. Controls: Press Z to begin. Use the arrow keys to slash the fruits appearing on screen\\n\\n\\n## Rives approach\\n\\nIn Rives we value a very high standard for decentralization and security. We want anyone to be able to verify that a match outcome matches the claim and we want that to happen even if the honest player is surrounded by opponents colluding. The way we handle this is quite different from other approaches. At the base of our technology we use Cartesi Rollups: Cartesi Rollups are an OR solution that creates a rollup per application and with an execution environment called the Cartesi Machine. The Cartesi Machine is a deterministic RISC-V Linux-enabled emulator capable of executing traditional (web2) software stacks and enabling computations multiple orders of magnitude larger than what the base layer allows, with reasonable costs. Remember the computation capacity and costs for Ethereum presented earlier in this article? Just booting a lean Ubuntu distro with no graphical interface takes under a second on a Cartesi Machine in a regular laptop, and that accounts for over 3B RISC-V instructions. That alone would take the processing power of over an hour of the Ethereum network and cost over 270k USD. The tech is pretty amazing and if you want to read more about it you can do so on [their site](https://cartesi.io).\\n\\nLeveraging the power of the Cartesi technology we did something pretty interesting: we ported the Cartesi Machine to webassembly. Because of that, we can run Cartesi computations in the browser, directly on the client with no need for any special setups on the user machine (and yes, we have a full Linux distro running in there). Why did we do that? We want both players and developers to have a good experience with Rives. If we had games in which the client would basically render the interface and relay the player inputs to the blockchain, retrieving the updated game state for it, we would have high latency and that would severely limit the kind of games that could be developed (should be delay tolerant games, like turn based games). By having games running directly on the user browser we can have highly interactive games and latency is not an issue. Ok, but you could develop games directly on the browser, why the Cartesi Machine? Great question! The answer is pretty simple: when you have a decentralized game, you need the game logic to be deterministic in order to have others verifying it and reach consensus and it\'s pretty difficult to write deterministic software as there are so many sources of entropy: unspecified hardware behavior (like for floating point operations), wall clocks, different versions of runtime environment components, etc. Using a Cartesi Machine on the browser instantly makes any game running inside it deterministic! The game developer can focus on building their game without having to worry about making their code deterministic.\\n\\nThe basic flow in Rives today is: \\nThe user enters [our site](https://rives.io) and selects a game. When they do that, they download to their computer our fantasy console (RIV) and the cartridge containing the game they want to play (both downloaded from the Rives Cartesi Rollup node and verifiable on chain). \\nThe user then executes the game locally and has a smooth experience - plays the game in real time, hopefully has some fun :) - and while that is happening, RIV logs all the player actions and the tick in the game simulation in which they happened. \\nAfter they are done, this log is submitted onchain to the Rives Cartesi Rollup in a very efficient compact format. When that happens, a Rives validator will download the gameplay and reproduce the entire game simulation, validating the score, achievements and any other relevant outcome of that gaming session. Periodically Rives validators submit a claim on chain about the state of the Rives application. The current model is authority based but we\xb4ll migrate to a decentralized model in which if a wrong claim is submitted a single honest validator is enough to enforce the right state (security guarantee inherited from the Cartesi Rollups, checkout [the whitepaper](https://cdn.sanity.io/files/zg5gx8g4/production/80a9e273750ef765a011a0ccc822b49f797fd7fd.pdf) and the [scientific paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12439) for the future version that converges faster in case of multiple disputes).\\n\\n## The RIV API\\n\\nTo make it easy for developers to create their games without a steep learning curve, RIV has a powerful and simple API. The API is available in C but you can easily code in your preferred language with a simple wrapper for it. There are multiple examples in different languages available [here](https://github.com/rives-io/riv/tree/main/demos), and we have a comprehensive documentation for you to get started available [here](https://docs.rives.io). Recently we had [our first game jam](https://docs.rives.io/blog/jam1recap) and most developers were able to get started on Rives, read the documentation and develop their own game within one or two days. Our focus with Rives is making retro style games a joy, fast and easy to develop and publish. Currently the focus is on single-player or local co-op games, but we are working on different approaches to enable co-op games over network and later adversarial games (which are particularly challenging to protect from bad behavior on a decentralized setup - but that is a topic to explore in a future article :) ). RIV currently runs a custom Linux distro called RIV OS based on Alpine Linux and gives a lot of flexibility and nice tooling to make developing a Rives game an enjoyable experience.\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"><div class=\\"rivemu-compact-frame pixelated\\">\\n![Space cookies invasion](/img/blog/space_cookies_invasion.png)\\n</div></div>\\n> A space cookie invaders might be the next game you want to make\\n\\nOk, that was a pretty long article, so thank you for taking the time to read it and making it this far.

The Jam was also hosted on [Itch.io](https://itch.io/jam/rives1) and is the first in many RIVES jams to come!!\\n\\nWe had over 40 participants and 9 submissions for this first edition. The jam focused on retro games with metrics to establish a score. A metric system (that can be used to establish a score) was a requirement for this jam. RIVES can natively add players to leaderboards based on their scores, making this an interesting criteria for the jam.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nCheck out the great games developed during the jam below. You can test them directly here, or compete onchain in the RIVES app. \\n\\n\\n### Peeyow by [Ednekebno](https://x.com/ednekebno)\\n\\nThe plot of every good sci-fi movie but now you can live and breathe it in a retro game! Your planet is under attack, so you fight some colorful alien spaceships. It\'s a side-scrolling shooter and the enemies have unique movement/shooting patterns. Read through the full description to get even more pumped before you give it a try.

This is the firs game he submitted, and it helped him get used to the system. It\'s a color-matching puzzle game. It looks like tetris on the surface but has its own unique set of rules. Beyond creating a fun game, this project is also technically interesting. The cartridge has a built-in MIDI player, which can play .mid files.\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"><iframe src=\\"https://emulator.rives.io/#simple=true&cartridge=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edubart/cartridges/main/jam1/blockie.sqfs\\" allowFullScreen className=\\"rivemu-frame\\"></iframe></div>\\n\\n> Controls: Up to rotate blocks, Left and Right to move\\n\\n\\n - [Itch page](https://ednekebno.itch.io/blockie)\\n\\n###  Real ninja challenge by [AleisterCodely](https://x.com/AleisterCodely) \\n\\nI love slashing fruits almost as much as I love eating them.

Beyond being a score-based game, this could be an interesting fit for tapes. Build out a beautiful city, and interesting road systems and generate a unique tape of your setup.\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"><iframe src=\\"https://emulator.rives.io/#simple=true&cartridge=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edubart/cartridges/main/jam1/simple-city-builder.sqfs\\" allowFullScreen className=\\"rivemu-frame\\"></iframe></div>\\n\\n> Controls: Q: open menu, arrows: move and pick location, F/W: build\\n\\n - [Itch page](https://deluxe1337.itch.io/simple-city-builder)\\n\\n### River Rives by [pickleberto](https://x.com/pickleberto)\\n\\nI was not born yet when the [Atari 2600](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_2600) came out, so this was my first time getting the [River Raid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Raid) feeling.

Danilo shipped this game in record time, the jam had just started. I remember playing this on the iPod Nano back in the early 2000s. I could see mods/custom rules emerge around a base game like Breakout.\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"><iframe src=\\"https://emulator.rives.io/#simple=true&cartridge=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edubart/cartridges/main/jam1/breakout.sqfs\\" allowFullScreen className=\\"rivemu-frame\\"></iframe></div>\\n\\n> Controls: Arrows to move, Z to kickoff ball\\n\\n - [Itch page](https://dtuler.itch.io/breakout-rives)\\n - [Github](https://github.com/tuler/breakout-rives)\\n\\n### Dave Raid by [Fabio Oshiro](https://x.com/fabiooshiro)\\n\\nFabio built a very cool combo game. Shoot down the red enemies with your fighter plane, and then answer trivia questions to move to the next stage. Love the questions and lore which center around cartesi, the tech used to power rives. Make sure to read the description on itch. Fun concept!\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"><iframe src=\\"https://emulator.rives.io/#simple=true&cartridge=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edubart/cartridges/main/jam1/dave-raid.sqfs\\" allowFullScreen className=\\"rivemu-frame\\"></iframe></div>\\n\\n> Controls: Arrows: move, S: fire\\n\\n - [Itch page](https://fabiooshiro.itch.io/dave-raid)\\n - [Github](https://github.com/fabiooshiro/dave-raid)\\n\\n### Bladebomber by [Edubart](https://github.com/edubart)\\n\\nEduardo is part of the core RIVES team, focused on building RIV itself (so the game was disqualified from prizes). Bladebomber is written in pure C. Eduardo built it to demonstrate the RIV console C API. Furthermore it can serve as an example or template for future dungeon-crawler-type games on RIVES. A player could also easily build custom maps to extend the game in the future. This is a beautiful and fun game to play, and I love how Eduardo got to build this with his girlfriend who focused on designing the levels.\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"><iframe src=\\"https://emulator.rives.io/#simple=true&cartridge=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edubart/cartridges/main/jam1/bladebomber.sqfs\\" allowFullScreen className=\\"rivemu-frame\\"></iframe></div>\\n\\n> Controls: UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT: Walk, Z: Dash, X : Use blade, C: Use bomb\\n\\n - [Itch page](https://edubart.itch.io/bladebomber)\\n - [Github](https://github.com/edubart/bladebomber)\\n\\n### Life is hard by [Lyno](https://github.com/lynoferraz)\\n\\nThis is not just any game, it\'s \\"[Game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)\\" running on RIVES! Lyno is also a core RIVES team member and wanted to build a unique game that uniquely fits tapes. The lifeforms you create can take on many shapes, making every tape a unique creation/life that can be shared, collected, and enjoyed. To play, place the desired cells and let the simulation run. Lyno also added an interesting metric system which you can read about on the itch page. \\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"><iframe src=\\"https://emulator.rives.io/#simple=true&cartridge=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edubart/cartridges/main/jam1/life.sqfs\\" allowFullScreen className=\\"rivemu-frame\\"></iframe></div>\\n\\n> Controls: Arrows: move the cursor and keep pressed to move faster, Z/A1 to set/unset cell,  X/A2: to start the simulation\\n\\n- [Itch page](https://fergo6.itch.io/life-is-hard)\\n- [Github](https://github.com/edubart/bladebomber)\\n\\n\\n## After-Jam\\n\\nThanks to everyone who participated. Every one of these games is amazing in their unique way. We were blown away by the great builders and games that were created. There was also a vote for prizes, where submitters and organizers could vote on itch. The final winners were:\\n\\n1: Peeyow\\n2: Blockie\\n3: Real Ninja challenge.\\n\\nWe hope that everyone who participated enjoyed building on RIVES. One of our key objectives is to bring back the joy of creating (games). We look forward to seeing you continue to build out your games and/or start a new one. Keep an eye out for Jam #2 coming soon!\\n\\nYou can also view the post-jam community call video below, where we play the games and discuss feedback and impressions from the participants and players.\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"><iframe id=\\"ytplayer\\" type=\\"text/html\\" width=\\"640\\" height=\\"360\\"\\n  src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EJotbYRbmgk\\"\\n  frameborder=\\"0\\"></iframe></div>"}]}}')}}]);
